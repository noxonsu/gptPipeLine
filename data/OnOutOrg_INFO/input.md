Whats is revshare?
Introducing our "revenue share" model tools - available to use for free! Once you start earning from these tools, we will charge only 1/5 of your profit (not volume). Alternatively, you can avoid this fee by purchasing the premium version of the tool.
Our RevShare model offers several benefits, including the ability to start using the tools for free, only paying for them when they generate profit. This means you can test out the tools without any upfront costs.
Additionally, our pricing model is aligned with the value our tools provide to our customers, as we only earn revenue when our tools generate revenue for our users. This encourages us to continue improving our tools to maximize your profits.

The company's founder, Alex Noxon, has been a registered member of Envato Market - the lead marketplace for selling code for over eight years. As an Elite Author, Trendsetter, Weekly Top Seller, he has sold more than $250,000 on Envato Market and has had items that were trending and ranked among the weekly top sellers across the entire marketplace.

I am not a coder and I cannot do all that I wanted to with this plugin... I hope not but might end up loosing my money or spending hours on this. However, support has been awesome thus far! I don't agree with the bad review about the seller. I understand we are all busy and this is not some mega corporation, so a bit of patience will pay off.

F.A.Q.
F.A.Q.
Do you have any guaranties the funds will be safu?
Risk notification: Our code is based on top audited sources, but our changes are unaudited from 3rd party auditors. We improve security but a lot of things are out of our control, for example, 3rd party software like WordPress, your server's software, your hosting provider. We have delivered dapps for hundreds of clients which handle tens of thousands of users. For the past 3 years, we have received about 10 incident reports kind of "a user lost funds". Unfortunately, not all of them have been resolved. Ask yourself who other than you can access your server? When was your last time installing security updates? The most secure choice would be our cloud solution (with a "revenue-share" payment model) contact support for more information. For WP standalone versions please use as less plugins as you can and the "Simply Static plugin" and "Wodefence" for security.
